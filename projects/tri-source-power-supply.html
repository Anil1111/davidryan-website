    <h1>3 Source Power Supply</h1>
    <p>
      This project was made possible by three high quality DC to DC converters
      that I obtained from my internship over the summer of 2020 at Virtual
      Incision. These DIN rail mounted converters are from Bel Power (Model:
      LDD240-WU) and provide DC to DC conversion with an output of 5-55VDC base
      on a input of 10A and 12-48VDC. Each power supply has several safety over
      current and under voltage protections that make each modal a self
      contained high preforming DC to DC converter. I received three of these
      modals<br />

      <h3>Added AC to DC converter support</h3>

      I purchased a single 24V 10A AC to DC converter figure out how I was going
      to mount it. I will eventually need three. I added a third support that
      extends off the base. There are three nails that are inserted
      perpendicularly into each side of the support for a total of 6. These
      nails will support velcro straps that will strap the AC to DC converters
      down.

      <h3>Constructed Frame</h3>

      I purchased an aluminum 12in DIN rail to mount all three of the voltage
      converters on. I designed a simple mounting frame out of 2x4. There are
      two posts that stand vertically on a base to make a U shaped frame. The
      DIN rail is mounted on the back side of the frame so that the voltage
      converters can rest on the inside of the U shape.
