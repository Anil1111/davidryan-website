  <h1>About the Site</h1>
  <p>
    This website was written in HTML and CSS. Each project page on this site contains a summery, a timeline and a parts list of the project. The summery is at the top of the page and includes: the title, a description of the project and pictures of the project. The timeline is a list of the major mile stones of the project with the date and a short description. The dates descends from greatest to least. The parts list is a table of the major parts used in the project with links to purchasable ones. 
    <br>This site is divided into two main sections: 
      <ol>
        <li>Active Projects</li>
        <li>Project Archive</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      ==>The Active projects section is populated with projects that have not reach a meaningful conclusion or I am still actively working on. I have not finalized the any pages in the Active Projects section so information that it contains could be considered a draft.
      <br>==>The Project Archive section contains projects that I have finished or have ceased working on. At this point I have attempted to finalize the page with as much helpful and accurate information as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
      The Resume and Contact section provides contact information and a short Bio for me as well as my most up-to-date resume.<br>
